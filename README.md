Map: MTR System Map, circles for buttons(function inside also) [btw, they may be at wrong pos if u scale the webpage, especially if u use mobile.]
Clicked 1 of the buttons would show the info of the station(Name of the station, 4trains of both sides.)

SearchArea: i should provide the pre-input values, im sorry that i didnt show them now.
